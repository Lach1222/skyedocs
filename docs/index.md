## What is humm?
Huumm launched as part of FlexiGroup’s product portfolio in 2019. Humm is changing the way consumers are transacting online and forming part of people’s every day shopping experiences. It allows consumers to buy now and pay later. 

Huumm integrates seamlessly with a number of leading eCommerce solutions including Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, Presta Shop, OpenCart and Cube Cart.

### How it works 
Huumm is integrated at point of sale, in-store and on-line. The customer signs up and is able to transact using their credit or debit card. The transaction is broken into smaller payments, allowing the customer to acquire their purchase before it has been fully paid for.
